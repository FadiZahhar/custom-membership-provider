Custom Membership Provider integration in Sitefinity
==========================
Sitefinity supports out of the box integration with custom membership providers. This allows developers to authenticate their users against custom user stores, instead of the default membership provider, that comes with Sitefinity.

The given example is a fully functional implementation of the standard SqlMembershipProvider, with support for evaluating basic queryable expressions. The example is used to demonstrate how developers can integrate their custom membership provider in Sitefinity.
